A set of scripts to help boostrap Vagrant base boxes.

VMs should be setup as follows:
- Disable USB
- Disable audio
- RAM: 360MB or 256MB
- Disk: 40GB

Use the following options during installs:
- User: vagrant:vagrant
- Hostname: vagrant-<osname>-<variant> (eg vagrant-maverick64-rvm)

The following commands are useful for SSHing into boxes during setup via port
forwarding on port 2222:
ssh -o UserKnownHostsFile=/dev/null -o StrictHostKeyChecking=no -p 2222 vagrant@localhost
scp -o UserKnownHostsFile=/dev/null -o StrictHostKeyChecking=no -P 2222 script-name.sh vagrant@localhost:

Misc notes:
- It's useful to increase RAM during RVM installation.

Ideas for the future:
- Automate VM creation using VBoxManage.
- Automate Ubuntu install using preseed file.
